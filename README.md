## 💡 How it Works: The Eisenhower Matrix

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | **Do First**: Tasks with clear deadlines and significant consequences. | **Schedule**: Tasks without immediate deadlines but help you achieve long-term goals. |
| **Not Important** | **Delegate**: Tasks that need to be done but don't require your specific skill set. | **Eliminate**: Distractions and low-value activities. |
